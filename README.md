# Ingress NGINX Controller

This App installs the [Ingress NGINX Controller] onto your workload cluster.

Its job is to satisfy external requests to services running in the cluster.
See the [kubernetes ingress docs] for a higher level overview.

Some of our clusters do not come with an ingress controller installed by default,
that way you can pick one of the implementations that best suits your needs.
This is one of the more popular ingress controllers.

Ingress controllers watch the kubernetes api server's `/ingresses` endpoint for
updates to the Ingress resource.

## Upgrading notes

Version [v2.26.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2260---2023-03-09) drops support for the following `values.yaml` keys:

- `controller.service.internal.labels`: Replaced by `controller.service.labels`.
- `controller.service.internal.type`: Replaced by `controller.service.type`.
- `controller.service.internal.ports.http`: Replaced by `controller.service.ports.http`.
- `controller.service.internal.ports.https`: Replaced by `controller.service.ports.https`.

In most deployments the replacement `values.yaml` keys are already defined and, in some cases, might not meet your requirements. Please check the [default values](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/blob/main/helm/ingress-nginx/values.yaml) included in the release you're upgrading to and those defined in your environment for these `values.yaml` keys to prevent any unintended changes to your deployment, especially the `Service` objects managed by this chart.

Version [2.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#220---2021-09-09) of the Ingress NGINX Controller app contains version [1.0.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/controller-v1.0.0)

### Prerequisites
- kubernetes version >= 1.19
- requires `networking.k8s.io/v1` (`extensions/v1beta1` or `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` are no longer supported)
- An IngressClass (One will be created when installing app version [2.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#220---2021-09-09))

Additionally, you'll have to make sure your Ingress resources are using the `spec.IngressClassName` (or the deprecated `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation) matching the name of your IngressClass (default `nginx`).

In case it is not possible to update all Ingress resources to specify the `spec.IngressClassName`, you can specify `controller.watchIngressWithoutClass` to `true` in your [user configuration](#configuration-options). Please make sure there is no other Ingress Controller deployed to your cluster.

You can find more information in the upstream [migration to networking.k8s.io/v1 FAQ](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/index.md#faq---migration-to-apiversion-networkingk8siov1).

If you are installing [multiple Ingress NGINX Controllers](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/ingress/multi-nginx-ic/)
each needs to have a unique ingress class. You also need to use the values structure below.
**Note:** This is a **breaking change** from older releases which used `controller.ingressClass`.

e.g.
```
controller:
  ingressClassResource:
    name: nginx-internal
    controllerValue: "k8s.io/ingress-nginx-internal"
```

**Attention:** It is not possible to change the `controller.ingressClassResource` values after installation. If you need to change these values, you'll need to uninstall first.

## Installing

There are 3 ways to install this app onto a workload cluster.

1. [Using our web interface](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/web/app-platform/#installing-an-app)
2. [Using our API](https://docs.giantswarm.io/api/#operation/createClusterAppV5)
3. Directly creating the [App custom resource](https://docs.giantswarm.io/use-the-api/management-api/crd/apps.application.giantswarm.io/) on the management cluster.

### Sample values files for the web interface and API

This is an example of the values file you could upload using our web interface.

```
# values.yaml

configmap:
  error-log-level: info
```

If you are not using the web interface, our (deprecated) API takes the same
structure but formatted as JSON:

```
# values.json

{
  "configmap": {
    "error-log-level": "info"
  }
}
```

### Sample App CR and ConfigMap for the management cluster

If you have access to the Kubernetes API on the management cluster, you could create
the App CR and ConfigMap directly.

Here is an example that would install the ingress-nginx to
workload cluster `abc12`:

```
# appCR.yaml
apiVersion: application.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1
kind: App
metadata:
  labels:
  name: ingress-nginx

  # workload cluster resources live in a namespace with the same ID as the
  # workload cluster.
  namespace: abc12

spec:
  name: ingress-nginx
  namespace: kube-system
  catalog: giantswarm
  version: 2.2.0

  userConfig:
    configMap:
      name: ingress-nginx-user-values
      namespace: abc12
```

```
# user-values-configmap.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap

metadata:
  name: ingress-nginx-user-values
  namespace: abc12

data:
  values: |
    configmap:
      error-log-level: info
```

If you feel like any of the configuration values need to be encrypted at rest,
you can also provide a secret. For this app we don't think there are any
configuration values that need to be encrypted.

It is a convention to call the user level configmap `{app-name}-user-values`.
So in this case we called the ConfigMap `ingress-nginx-user-values`

If you place these files in a folder called `foldername`, you could use the
command: `kubectl apply foldername`, to deploy this app to a workload cluster
with id `abc12`.

See our [full reference page on how to configure applications](https://docs.giantswarm.io/app-platform/app-configuration/) for more details.

### Important note about required cluster level config

#### Version 2.17 and above.

Starting from version 2.17, the ingress-nginx does not require the dedicated
`ingress-controller-values` ConfigMap. Instead, it can make use of the `<CLUSTER_NAME>-cluster-values`.

When creating this App using our web interface or our API, `spec.config` will be set automatically, 
but if you are creating the App CR yourself you must remember to do this. 

#### Older versions.

The `ingress-controller-values` ConfigMap referenced in the `spec.config` field of the App CR
is required for the ingress controller to work properly.

`ingress-controller-values` is created by our operators and it helps set values
unique to your workload cluster. When creating this App using our web interface or
our API, `spec.config` will be set automatically, but if you are creating the App CR
yourself you must remember to do this. 

## Configuration Options

All configuration options are documented in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/blob/main/helm/ingress-nginx/values.yaml) file.

### Internal nginx IC options

This chart contains a template for an additional [internal service](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/blob/main/helm/ingress-nginx/templates/controller-service-internal.yaml) to cover the use case of having separate internal and external ingress routes with a single nginx IC instance.

Valid configuration options are as follows:

**Only external (default)**

This is the default behavior. No additional configuration required.

 **Make default service internal**

This configures the [default service](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/blob/main/helm/ingress-nginx/templates/controller-service.yaml) to spawn an internal facing load balancer. This disables the external ingress.
 ```yaml
controller:
  service:
    public: false
 ```

 **Create additional internal service**

This enables the additional internal service template which creates an internal facing load balancer.

```yaml
controller:
  service:
    internal:
      enabled: true
```

Other possible configurations are:
- Two internal load balancer
- Disable default service completely `controller.service.enabled: false`

### AWS and PROXY Protocol

Since version 2.17, this chart has the `use-proxy-procotol` enabled by default when installed in AWS. 

To disable this behavior, it's still possible to set `configmap.use-proxy-protocol: "false"` in the values file.

## Limitations

Some of our apps have certain restrictions on how they can be deployed.
Not following these limitations will most likely result in a broken deployment.

- This app _must_ reference the `ingress-controller-values` ConfigMap in its `spec.config` field.

## For developers

### Installing the Chart locally

To install the chart locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app.git
$ cd ingress-nginx-app
$ helm install helm/ingress-nginx
```

Provide a custom `values.yaml`:

```bash
$ helm install ingress-nginx -f values.yaml
```

### Release Process

* Ensure CHANGELOG.md is up to date.
* Create a new branch with name `main#release#vX.X.X`. Automation will create a release PR.
* Merging the release PR will push a new git tag and trigger a new tarball to be pushed to the
[giantswarm-catalog].
* Test and verify the ingress controller release across supported environments in a new or existing WIP platform release.

# What is this repo?

This repo contains a helm chart for the [Giant Swarm App Platform].
While it is _just a Helm chart_, there might be some Giant Swarm App Platform
specific values in the templates.

It is available as an `App` in the `giantswarm-catalog` and `giantswarm-test-catalog`.

You will also find it in the `default-catalog` and the `default-test-catalog`,
those catalogs are not visible in our web interface. This is to support the
platforms and cluster versions where the Ingress NGINX Controller is still a
default app (i.e. it gets installed automatically during cluster creation)
