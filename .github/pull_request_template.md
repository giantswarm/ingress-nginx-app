For changes in the chart, chart templates and container images, I executed the following tests, using the `hello-world` app, to verify them in live environments:

| Test / Provider                             | AWS | Azure |
| ------------------------------------------- | --- | ----- |
| Upgrade from previous version               |     |       |
| Existing `Ingress` resources are reconciled |     |       |
| Fresh install                               |     |       |
| Fresh `Ingress` resources are reconciled    |     |       |
